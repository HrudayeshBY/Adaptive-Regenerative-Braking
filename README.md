Here is the details about our progress in developing the responsive adative regenerative braking system:

We faced challenges in calibrating the MPU6050 sensor, particularly with the Z-axis, and accurately identifying states like downhill, coasting, and cornering.
To address these, we smoothed the sensor data, implemented count-based checks, and added conditions to filter out false data and noise.
This helped us achieve reliable and responsive state detection for adaptive braking

Weâ€™ve successfully developed functional code for adaptive regenerative braking, including state detection and relay latching.
